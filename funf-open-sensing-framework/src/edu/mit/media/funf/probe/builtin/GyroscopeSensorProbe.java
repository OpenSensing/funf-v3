/**
 * Measures angular speed around each axis.
 * 
 * All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation around the X, Y and Z axis. 
 * The coordinate system is the same as is used for the acceleration sensor. 
 * Rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is, an observer looking from some positive location on the x, y. or z axis at a device positioned on the origin would report positive rotation if the device appeared to be rotating counter clockwise. 
 * Note that this is the standard mathematical definition of positive rotation and does not agree with the definition of roll given earlier.
