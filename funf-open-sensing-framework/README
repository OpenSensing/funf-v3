== Building the project ==
The Funf project can be used as an Android library, or can be packaged as a jar file.  
The typical method of using Funf is by using the Funf jar file.  To build the funf jar 
file, use the 'release' target of the Ant build script.  (Make sure you have ant 1.8.* 
or later installed.)  Then, copy the jar file (bin/funf.jar) to the libs directory of your project.
The Android build scripts (Command line Ant or in Eclipse) will take care of compiling
the jar.

If you think that you will be making frequent changes to the Funf library, you may
want to integrate Funf as a library project.
To use it as an Android library, add this project as a library dependency of your 
Android application project.  See the following links for more details.
